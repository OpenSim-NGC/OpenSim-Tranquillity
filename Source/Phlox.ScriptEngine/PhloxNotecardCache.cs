/*
 * Two small pieces of Halcyon the anti-abuse slowdowns need.
 *
 * PhloxNotecardCache is Halcyon's NotecardCache (InWorldz.Phlox.Engine/LSLSystemAPI.cs:18541-18727): parsed notecards
 * by asset id, so repeated reads of one notecard are answered from memory instead of an asset fetch each. As Halcyon's:
 * an entry is refreshed by every read of it, IsCached does not look at age, and CacheCheck - run on every read that
 * missed the cache - drops the entries not read for more than NOTECARD_CACHE_TIMEOUT (60 s). Unlike Halcyon's (one
 * static cache per process), there is one per region's engine. It holds the lines Phlox already parsed a notecard into
 * without a cache (LSLSystemAPI.StripNotecardHeader, then Card.SplitLines), so a cached read answers exactly what a fetch does.
 * Asset ids are content addresses: a notecard saved with new text gets a new asset id, so an entry never goes stale.
 *
 * MovingIntegerAverage is Halcyon's (OpenSim/Framework MovingIntegerAverage): the last n values, averaged with integer
 * division, 0 when empty.
 *
 * Adapted 2026 by Legion Builds
